<h1>About</h1>
<div class="line"></div>
<p class="para"> I often read Books. There are many books like Bhagvad Gita, Mahabharata, Ramayana and many more.... I read books daily. It also increases our knoledge. Reading Books is good as they have the power to make one intelligent, rationale, and creative. Books make people test, refine and sharpen personal beliefs against others, and they become important sources of information in telling the history. "Reading is essential for those who seek to rise above the ordinary." This is a Beautiful Quote told by an author named Jim Rohn. <br> <br><br> 5 reasons to Read Books: <br> <br> 
1) You can't write if you don't read. <br>
2) Your general knowledge is abysmal if you don't read. <br>
3) It helps you develop your own philosophy on life. <br>
4) It helps you develop critical thinking skills.<br>
5) You can de-stress with minimal expense. <br> <br>
